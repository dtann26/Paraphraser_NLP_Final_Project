(Still need fixing)

Paraphraser Model <br>
This project implements a T5-based text paraphrasing model trained on the Quora Question Pairs and PAWS datasets. The model takes an input text and generates semantically equivalent variations with different wording.

Features
- Text paraphrasing using fine-tuned T5 transformer model
- Evaluation using multiple metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and ParaScore
- Web interface for interactive paraphrasing

<br>
Metrics
The model has been evaluated using:

- BLEU: N-gram precision metric
- ROUGE: Recall-oriented metric for summarization/paraphrasing
- METEOR: Metric considering stemming and synonyms
- ParaScore: Semantic similarity metric based on BERT embeddings
